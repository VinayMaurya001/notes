WEB DESIGN VS. DEVELOPMENT
	Web designers create the overall look and feel of a website
	Web developers implement the design using HTML, CSS and JavaScript code
	
WHY TAKE DESIGN SERIOUSLY?
	GOOD DESIGN
		Creates an immediate and lasting good impression of the brand or product;
		Makes the user trust the brand right away;
		Increases the user’s perceived value of the brand or product;
		Gives users exactly what they were looking for when coming to the site, e.g. purchasing a product or finding information.
	
	BAD DESIGN
		Makes users believe the brand doesn’t really care about their product or service;
		Makes the user insecure about trusting the brand;
		Makes the brand or product seem “cheap”;
		Leaves users confused, and makes it hard to for them to reach their goal.

ANYONE CAN LEARN GOOD DESIGN!
	Good web design is not subjective or creative 	
	Everyone can learn basics by following a framework/system

WEB DESIGN RULES #1:TYPOGRAPHY
	01. Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
		SERIF -Creates a traditional/classic look and feel
		SANSSERIF-Modern look and feel
			Inter
			Open Sans
			Roboto
	02. It’s okay to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces
	03. Choose the right typeface according to your website personality 
			Choose the right personality for your website (more on this later)
			Decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface
			Experiment with all the “good” typefaces (and other typefaces from Google Fonts!) 
				to see which ones best fits your website’s message (this will come with experience)
			You can keep trying different typefaces as you design and build the page
	04. When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a “type scale” tool or other pre-defined range
	05. Use a font size between 16px and 32px for “normal” text 
	06. For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger
	07. For headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), depending on personality
	08. For any text, don’t use a font weight under 400 (regular)
	09. Use less than 75 characters per line
	10. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5
	11. Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience)
	12. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing
	13. Usually, don’t justify text 
	14. Don’t center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine

WEB DESIGN RULES #2: COLORS
	01. Make the main color match your website’s personality: colors convey meaning!
		Red draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion, and excitement
		Orange is less aggressive, and conveys happiness, cheerfulness, and creativity
		Yellow means joy, brightness, and intelligence
		Greens represents harmony, nature, growth, and health
		Blue is associated with peace, trustworthiness, and professionalism
		Purple conveys wealth, wisdom, and magic
		Pink represents romance, care, and affection
		Brown is associated with nature, durability and comfort
		Black symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grief and sorrow
	02. Use a good color tone! Don’t choose a random tone or CSS named colors.

	03. You need at least two types of colors in your color palette: a main color and a grey color
	04. With more experience, you can add more colors: accent (secondary) 	colors (use a tool)

	05. For diversity, create lighter and darker “versions” (tints and shades)
			https://maketintsandshades.com/
	06. Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page
	07. Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or 	sections stand out
	08. You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations
	09. On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background (“lighter 	version”) for text
	10. Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten if up it looks heavy and uninviting
	11. Don’t make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors
