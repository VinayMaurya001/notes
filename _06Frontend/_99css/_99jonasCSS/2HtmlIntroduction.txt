<h1></h1> to <h6></h6> for heading. 
	In a page we should have only one h1 & multiple h2 to h6 tags.
<p></p> for paragraph
We should use <strong> tag instead of <b>. Semantic Html (tag name should have meaning or purpose attached to it)
We should use <em> tag instead of <i>. Semantic Html

Advantage of Semantic Html 
	search engine optimization,which basically means that search engines,such as Google will be able to understand the structure of your content, 
		and therefore, they will be better able to analyze what your content and what your webpage is all about.
	important for accessibility, and especially for people who rely on screen readers to consume our webpages.

<aside>The aside element is usually used for some secondary information that complements the information in the main part of the page.
		Now visually, many times we use the aside element as a sidebar, but it doesn't have to be that way.
