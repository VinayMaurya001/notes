Devops
	It is a philosophy of combining Dev & Ops team at culture, practice & tools level. 
	
DevOps Lifecycle
	Code
		Developers commits code
	Code build
		Deployable Software:Artifact
	Code Test
		Unit & Integration Test
	Code Analysis
		Vunerability, Bast Practices
	Delivery
		Deploy Changes to staging
	DB/Security/OS Changes
		Every other Ops changes
	Software Testing
		QA/Functional, load, performance tests
	Deploy to prod
	Go Live
		User traffic diverted to new changes
	User Approval
		User feedback
	Keep Monitoring
	

	


CI
	Continious Integration
		Code Commit -> Build => Test -> Artifactory Repo & Feedback/Notification
	
	Goal of CI
		The goal of CI is to detect defects at very early stage so it does not multiply.

	Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice 
		where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, 
		after which automated builds and tests are run

	Continious Deployment
	https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/
	Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.
	
	Deploy Automation->DB/Security Changes->Software Testing->Schedule PROD Deployment
	
	
	Deployment
		Server Provisioning
		Dependencies
		Config Changes
		Network
		Artifact Deploy
		& Many More
		
		
	Tools
		Ansible , Puppet, Chef (For System Automation)
		Terraform, Cloud Fromation(For cloud infrastructure automation)
		Jenkins, OctopusDeploy (For CICD Automation)	
		Helm Charts
		Code Depeloy
		
		
	Test Automation
		Functional 
		Load
		Performance
		DB
		Network & Security
		Any other test
	
	Automation Test written by Testers
