Linux Commands
	/notes/_07DevOps._99ImranAliSir._99LinuxCommands
		
Open Source
	Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance & redistribute.
	Common Misconception :"open source" just mean something is free of charge
		Some opensource software are not free. ?????
	
Linux Origins
	1984: The GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation
		Creates open source version of UNIX utilities
		Creates the General Public License (GPL)
			Software license enforcing open source principles

	1991: Linus Torvalds
		Creates open source, UNIX-like kernel, released under the GPL license
		Ports some GNU utilities, solicits assistance online
	Today:
		Linux kernel + GNU utilities = complete, open source, UNIX-like operating system
			Packaged for targeted audiences as distributions
 
Linux Principles
	Everything is a file (Including Hardware)
	Small Single purpose Programs
	Ability to chain programs together for complex operations
	Avoid Captive User Interface
	Configuration data stored in text file


Why Linux
	Opensource
	Community Support
	Support Wide Variety of Hardware
	Customization
	Most Servers runs on Linux
	Automation
	Security
	
Architecture of linux
	Hardware>Kernel>Shell(on which we execute command)>Applications
	
Popular Linux Distos
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions
	Desktop OS
		Ubuntu Linux
		Linux Mint
		Arch Linux
		Fedora
		Debian
		OpenSuse
	Server OS (don't have UI)
		Red Hat Enterprise Linux(Not Open Source)
		Ubuntu Server
		Centos
		SUSE Enterprise Linux
		
Most used Linux distros currently in IT industry.
	RPM based:- RHEL, Centos, Oracle Linux, Amazon Linux
		RPM or .rpm (Red Hat based softwares.)
		RPM was developed by Community & Red Hat.
	Debian based :- Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux
		DEB or .deb (Debian based softwares)
		DEB was developed by Bedian.
		Package Manager-YUM
		
Diffrence between RPM based and Debian based.
	From user’s point of view, there isn’t much difference in these tools. 
	The RPM and DEB formats are both just archive files, with some metadata attached to them. 
	They are both equally arcane, have hardcoded install paths and only differ in subtle details. 
	DEB files are installation files for Debian based distributions. 
	RPM files are installation files for Red Hat based distributions. 
	Ubuntu is based on Debian’s package manage based on APT and DPKG. 
	Red Hat, CentOS and Fedora are based on the old Red Hat Linux package management system, RPM.		
	RPM based Preferred for Servers-RHEL
	Debian based Preferred for devops-Ubuntu

	User Executable: /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin
	System Executables: /sbin, /usr/sbin,/usr/local/sbin
	Other Mountpoints: /media, /mnt
	Configuration: /etc
	Temporary Files: /tmp
	Kernels and Bootloader: /boot
