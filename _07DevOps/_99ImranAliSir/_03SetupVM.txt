Life before Virtualization
	One service- One Server(Isolation)
	Servers are always over-provisioned
		Server provisioning is the process of setting up a server to be used in a network based on required resources. 
			Provisioning can encompass all of the operations needed to create a new machine and bring it to a working state, 
				and includes defining the desired state of the system
	Server resources mostly underutilized
	Huge Capital & Operational Expenditure
	
Life after Virtualization
	Enter VMWare
	Allows one computer to run multiple OS
	Partition physical resource into virtual resource
	Virtual Machines runs in Isolated Environment
	Each VM needs it own OS
	Server virtualization is the most common virtualization
	Hardware> Hypervisor> VM1(Guest OS1+Applications1) +VM2(Guest OS2+Applications2)+ VM3(Guest OS3+Applications3)
	
	Terminologies	
		VM
			Virtual Machine
		Hypervisor
			Tool/software that let us create VM
			It enable Virtualization
			Type of Hypervisor
				Type1
					Bare Metal
					Runs as a base OS
					Only for Production
					It won't let you use this computer for other purposes 
					Ex: VMware esxi, Xen Hypervisor, HyperV
					Hardware> Hypervisor> VM1 +VM2+ VM3
				Type2
					Runs a software
					For learning & testing & not for production 
					Ex: 
						Oracle Virtualbox
						Vmware Server
						Vmware Workstation	
					Hardware> Native OS>(Applications+Type2Hypervisor)>	VM1(Guest OS1+Applications1) +VM2(Guest OS2+Applications2)+ VM3(Guest OS3+Applications3)	
		Host OS
		Guest OS
			OS of VM
		Snapshot
			Way for Backup of VM
			
			

If you want to automate anything, you should know how to do it manually.
	If you're trying to automate something that you don't know how to do manually, then trust me, you will be struggling a lot.


Oracle Virtualbox
	https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/hypervisor.html
	It is a Hypervisor to manage vm locally(Laptop/Desktop)

Vagrant
	https://www.vagrantup.com/intro
	It is a VM automation tool which uses hypervisor like Oracle VM virtualbox to manage vm's on our Laptop/Desktop
			
Enable Virtualization on windows
	Enable Virtualization in BIOS for Windows
		 VTx
		 Secure virtual machine
		 Virtualization
	
	Turn on/off window features

		 Microsoft Hyperv
			Windows Hypervisor platform
		 Windows Subsystem for linux
		 Docker Desktop
		 Virtual Machine Platform

Ubuntu server doesn't include a graphical user interface, while Ubuntu Desktop does 	

VM Setup
	Setup Hardware
		new-> select name, ram, hard disk type etc
	Settings
		System
			Processor
				CPU 1 to 2 for Ubuntu
		Storage
			iso file
		Network
			Enable Adapter2>Bridge Adapter>Wireless Network Adapter
	Install OS	
	Remove ISO file 
		SO it does not boot from iso file next time when we boot 
		Storage
			iso file
	
	ifconfig
	pwd
	ls
	
	Connect new VM using 
		ssh user@IP
			Putty
			GItbash
