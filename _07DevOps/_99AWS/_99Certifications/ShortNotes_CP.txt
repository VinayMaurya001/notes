What is a server composed of?
	Compute: CPU 
	Memory: RAM 
	Storage: Data
	Database: Store data in a structured way
	Network: Routers, switch, DNS server
	
	Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other
	Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet!
	Switch: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server / client on your network
	
	
	
Problems with traditional IT approach
	Pay for the rent for the data center
	Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
	Adding and replacing hardware takes time
	Scaling is limited
	Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
	How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fire…)
	
	
What is Cloud Computing?
	Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
	Some Cloud services- Gmail, Dropbox, Netflix
	
The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
	On-demand self service
		Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
	Broad network access
		Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
	Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
		Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
		Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
	Rapid elasticity and scalability
		Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed Quickly and easily scale based on demand
	Measured service
		Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
	Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
		Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware
		Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
	Benefit from massive economies of scale
		Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
	Stop guessing capacity
		Scale based on actual measured usage
	Increase speed and agility
	Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
	Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

Problems solved by the Cloud
	Flexibility: change resource types when needed
	Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
	Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
	Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
	High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
	Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

Types of Cloud Computing
	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
		Provide building blocks for cloud IT
		Provides networking, computers, data storage space
		Highest level of flexibility
		Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
		Amazon EC2 (on AWS) 
		GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
	Platform as a Service (PaaS)
		Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
		Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
		Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS) 
		Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)
	Software as a Service (SaaS)
		Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
		Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning) 
		Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom
		
Pricing of the Cloud
	Compute
		Pay for compute time
	Storage
		Pay for data stored in the Cloud
	Data transfer OUT of the Cloud
		Data transfer IN is free
	
The Deployment Models of the Cloud
	Private Cloud
	Public Cloud
	Hybrid Cloud
