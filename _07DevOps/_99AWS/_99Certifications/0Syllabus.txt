I used the free online mind mapping tool Coggle to create a mind map for the exam. I would periodically study the mind map to refresh my memory of the topics covered in the exam. If there were any concepts that I couldn’t remember, I’d go back and study them again. You can find my mind map below.

I have cleared my AWS solution architect associate and AWS sysops associate certifications.
I enrolled for Udemy courses for the same from Stephan Marek, Acloudguru and practice tests from John Bonso.
They also answer technical doubts and questions in the q&a section.
Before giving the exams I diligently went through aws white papers.
