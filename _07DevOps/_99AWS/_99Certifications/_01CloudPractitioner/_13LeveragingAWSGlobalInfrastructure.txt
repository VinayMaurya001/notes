Why make a global application?
	• A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies
	• On AWS: this could be Regions and / or Edge Locations
	• Decreased Latency
		• Latency is the time it takes for a network packet to reach a server
		• It takes time for a packet from Asia to reach the US
		• Deploy your applications closer to your users to decrease latency, better experience
	• Disaster Recovery (DR)
		• If an AWS region goes down (earthquake, storms, power shutdown, politics)…
		• You can fail-over to another region and have your application still working
		• A DR plan is important to increase the availability of your application
	• Attack protection: distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack 
	
Global AWS Infrastructure 
	• Regions: For deploying applications and infrastructure
	• Availability Zones:Made of multiple data centers
	• Edge Locations (Points of Presence for CDN): for content delivery as close as possible to users
	• More at:https://infrastructure.aws/

Global Applications in AWS
	• Global DNS: Route 53
		• Great to route users to the closest deployment with least latency
		• Great for disaster recovery strategies
	• Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): CloudFront
		• Replicate part of your application to AWS Edge Locations – decrease latency	
		• Cache common requests – improved user experience and decreased latency
	• S3 Transfer Acceleration
		• Accelerate global uploads & downloads into Amazon S3
	• AWS Global Accelerator:
		• Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
		
		
		
Amazon Route 53 Overview
	• Route53 is a Managed DNS (Domain Name System)
	• DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through URLs.
	• Route 53 features are (non exhaustive list): Domain Registration, DNS, Health Checks, Routing Policy
	• In AWS, the most common records are:
		• www.google.com => 12.34.56.78 == A record (IPv4)
		• www.google.com => 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 == AAAA IPv6
		• search.google.com => www.google.com == CNAME: hostname to hostname
		• example.com => AWS resource == Alias (ex: ELB, CloudFront, S3, RDS, etc…)
	• Route 53– Diagram for A Record	
		Web browser ->DNS Request myapp.mydomain.com ->Route 53 
			->Send back IP: 32.45.67.85 (A record: hostname to IP)->Web Browser
		Web browser->HTTP Request IP:32.45.67.85 Host: myapp.mydomain.com ->Application Server IP: 32.45.67.85
			->HTTP Response ->Web Browser
	• Route 53 Routing Policies
		• Need to know them at a high-level for the Cloud Practitioner Exam
		• SIMPLE ROUTING POLICY
			• No health checks
			• Web browser ->foo.example.com ->Route 53 ->A: 11.22.33.44 ->Web Broswer
		• WEIGHTED ROUTING POLICY
			• Have health checks
			• Route 53 ->70%->Instance70
						->20%->Instance20
						->10%->Instance10
		• LATENCY ROUTING POLICY 
			• Have health checks
		• FAILOVER ROUTING POLICY
			• Have health checks
			• Disaster Recovery
			• Route 53->Health CHeck on Primary Instance
						 ->InstancePrimary
						->InstanceFailover
			
		
Amazon CloudFront
	• Content Delivery Network (CDN)
	• Improves read performance,content is cached at the edge
	• Improves users experience
	• 216 Point of Presence globally (edge locations)
	• DDoS protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield,
	• AWS Web Application Firewall
	• Source: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/?nc=sn&loc=2
	• CloudFront – Origins
		• S3 bucket
			• For distributing files and caching them at the edge
			• Enhanced security with CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC)
			• OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity (OAI)
			• CloudFront can be used as an ingress (to upload files to S3)
		• Custom Origin (HTTP)
			• Application Load Balancer
			• EC2 instance
			• S3 website (must first enable the bucket as a static S3 website)
			• Any HTTP backend you want
	• CloudFront at a high level
	• CloudFront– S3 as an Origin
	• CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication
		• CloudFront:
			• Global Edge network
			• Files are cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
			• Great for static content that must be available everywhere
		• S3 Cross Region Replication:
			• Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
			• Files are updated in near real-time
			• Read only
			• Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions
	• With which services does CloudFront integrate to protect against web attacks?
		You can use AWS WAF web access control lists (web ACLs) to help minimize the effects of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 
		For additional protection against DDoS attacks, AWS also provides AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced.
			
			
S3 Transfer Acceleration
	• Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location
		which will forward the data to the S3 bucket in the target region			
	• Test the tool at: 
		https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html	
	• File in USA ->(public www)->Edge Location USA ->(private AWS)->S3 Bucket Australia 
	• Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. 
		Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. 
		As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.
		
			
			
AWS Global Accelerator
	• https://speedtest.globalaccelerator.aws/#/
	• Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
	• Leverage the AWS internal network to optimize the route to your application (60% improvement)
	• 2 Anycast IP are created for your application and traffic is sent through Edge Locations
	• The Edge locations send the traffic to your application			
	• USA ->Edge Location->Private AWS Network -> India
	• Without Global Accelerator
		Browser ->Loacal ISP ->Network A->Network B->Network N ->AWS Region
	• With Global Accelerator
		Browser ->Loacal ISP ->Edge Location->AWS Network ->AWS Region
		• https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/
	• AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
		• They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
		• Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
		• CloudFront – Content Delivery Network
			• Improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos)
			• Content is served at the edge
		• Global Accelerator
			• No caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
			• Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
			• Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
			• Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover
			
			
			
			
			
			
AWS Outposts 
	• Extension of AWS services on-premises
	• Hybrid Cloud: 
		businesses that keep an on - premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure
	• Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems: 
		• One for the AWS cloud (using the AWS console,CLI, and AWS APIs)
		• One for their on-premises infrastructure
	• AWS Outposts are “server racks” that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools
		to build your own applications on -premises just as in the cloud
	• AWS will setup and manage “Outposts Racks” within your on
		-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
	• You are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security
	• Benefits:
		• Low-latency access to on-premises systems
		• Local data processing
		• Data residency
		• Easier migration from on-premises to the cloud
		• Fully managed service
	• Some services that work on Outposts:			
		EC2
		EBS
		RDS
		S3
		EKS
		ECS
		EMR


AWS WaveLength
	• WaveLength Zones are infrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunications providers’ datacenters at the edge of the 5G networks
	• Brings AWS services to the edge of the 5G networks
	• Example: EC2, EBS, VPC…
	• Ultra-low latency applications through 5G networks
	• Traffic doesn’t leave the Communication Service Provider’s (CSP) network
	• High-bandwidth and secure connection to the parent AWS Region
	• No additional charges or service agreements
	• Use cases: 
		Smart Cities, ML-assisted diagnostics, Connected Vehicles, Interactive Live Video Streams,
			 AR/VR,Real-time Gaming, …				
	•Broswer ->Telecom carrier 5g Network ->Carrier Gateway->Wavelength Zone->Region		
	AWS Wavelength is an AWS Infrastructure offering optimized for mobile edge computing applications. Wavelength combines the high bandwidth and ultra-low latency of 5G networks with AWS compute and storage services to enable developers to innovate and build a whole new class of applications.
	
			
			
AWS Local Zones
	• AWS Local Zones are kind of (not exact) extension of Availability zone.??????
	• Places AWS compute, storage, database,and other selected AWS services 
		closer to end users to run latency-sensitive applications
	• Extend your VPC to more locations – “Extension of an AWS Region”
	• Compatible with EC2, RDS, ECS, EBS,ElastiCache, Direct Connect …
	• Example:
	• AWS Region: N. Virginia (us-east-1)
	• AWS Local Zones: Boston, Chicago, Dallas,Houston, Miami, …
