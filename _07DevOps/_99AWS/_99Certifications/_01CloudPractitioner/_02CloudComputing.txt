Server Composed Of
		Brain
			Compute:CPU
			Memory:RAM
		Storage: 
			Unstructured data
			Database:Store data in a structured way
		Netowrk:
			Routers,switch, DNS server			
			Network:Cables, routers & servers connected with each other
			Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computers in the networks. 
					They know where to sent your packets on the internet.
			Switch: Takes a packet & sent it to the correct server /client on network.

Problems with traditional IT Approach
	1)
		Pay for the rent for the data center
		Pay for power supply, cooling, maintenance
		Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
	2)
		Scaling up/down is limited
		Adding and replacing hardware takes time
	3)
		How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, power shutdown, fireï¿½)
	
	Can we externalize all this-that is in traditional IT Approach? 


What is Cloud Computing?
	Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources.
	Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
	
	Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
	You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
	You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
	Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services

	The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
		On-demand self service:
			Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
		Broad network access:
			Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
		Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
			Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
		 	Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
		Rapid elasticity and scalability:
			Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
			Quickly and easily scale based on demand
		Measured service:
			Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used
	
	Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, 
		while you provision and use what you need via a web application.


	Some Cloud services
		Gmail
			E-mail cloud service
			Pay for ONLY your emails stored (no infrastructure, etc.)
		Dropbox
			Cloud Storage Service
			Originally built on AWS
		Netflix
			Built on AWS
			Video on Demand

			
	Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
		Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
			Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware
			Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
		Benefit from massive economies of scale
			Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
		Stop guessing capacity
			Scale based on actual measured usage
		Increase speed and agility
		Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
		Go global in minutes
			Leverage the AWS global infrastructure

	Problems solved by the Cloud
		Flexibility: change resource types when needed
		Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
		Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
			Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
		High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
		Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
	

Types of Cloud Computing
	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
			Provide building blocks for cloud IT
			Provides networking, computers, data storage space
			Highest level of flexibility
			Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
			Example: Amazon EC2, GCP,Azure,Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
			Managed by You:
				Applications
				Data
				Runtime
				Middleware
				O/S
			Managed by AWS:
					Virtualization
					Servers
					Storage
					Networking
	Platform as a Service (PaaS)
			Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
			Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
			Example:Elastic Beanstalk(AWS), Heroku,Google App Engine(GCP), Windows Azure
			Managed by You:
				Applications
				Data
	Software as a Service (SaaS)
			Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
			Example: Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning) 
						   Google Apps (Gmail),
						   Dropbox, 
						   Zoom
	
	
The Deployment Models of the Cloud
	Private Cloud:
		Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
		Complete control
		Security for sensitive applications
		Meet specific business needs
		Example: rackspace
	
	Public Cloud:
		Cloud resources owned and operated by a thirdparty cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.
		Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
		Example: AWS, Azure, GCP
	
	Hybrid Cloud:
		Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
		Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
		Flexibility and cost effectiveness of the public cloud
		Example: IBM

Pricing of the AWS Cloud Quick Overview
	AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing model
	Compute:
		Pay for compute time
	Storage:
		Pay for data stored in the Cloud
	Data transfer OUT of the Cloud:
		Data transfer IN is free
	Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT
