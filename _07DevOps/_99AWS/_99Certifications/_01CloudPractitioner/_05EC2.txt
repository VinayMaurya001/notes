Amazon EC2
	• EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering
	• EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
	• It mainly consists in the capability of :
		• Renting virtual machines (EC2)
		• Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
		• Distributing load across machines (ELB)
		• Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
	• Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works


EC2 sizing & configuration options 
	• Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS 
	• How much compute power & cores (CPU) 
	• How much random-access memory (RAM) 
	• How much storage space: 
		• Network-attached (EBS & EFS) 
		• hardware (EC2 Instance Store) 
	• Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address 
	• Firewall rules: security group 
	• Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data


EC2 User Data
	• It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
	• bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
	• That script is only run once at the instance first start
	• EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
		• Installing updates
		• Installing software
		• Downloading common files from the internet
		• Anything you can think of
	• The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user



EC2 Instance Types - Overview
	• You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for different use cases 
		https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
		https://www.ec2instances.info/
		1)General purpose
		2)Compute optimized
		3)Memory optimized
		4)Accelerated computing
		5)Storage optimized
		6)HPC optimized
		7)Instance Features
		8)Measuring Instance Performance
	• AWS has the following naming convention:
		m5.2xlarge
		• m: instance class
		• 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
		• 2xlarge: size within the instance class


	EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose
		• Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
		• Balance between:
			• Compute
			• Memory
			• Networking
		• In the course, we will be using the t2.micro which is a General Purpose EC2
		instance
	
	EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized
		• Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
			• Batch processing workloads
			• Media transcoding
			• High performance web servers
			• High performance computing (HPC)
			• Scientific modeling & machine learning
			• Dedicated gaming servers
	
	
	EC2 Instance Types – Memory Optimized
		• Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
		• Use cases:
			• High performance, relational/non-relational databases
			• Distributed web scale cache stores(like elastic cache)
			• In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
			• Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data	
	
	
	
	EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized
		• Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write
		access to large data sets on local storage
		• Use cases:
			• High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
			• Relational & NoSQL databases
			• Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
			• Data warehousing applications
			• Distributed file systems




Introduction to Security Groups
	• Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
	• They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
	• Security groups only contain rules
	• Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
		WWW =>	Inbound traffic => Security Group => Ec2 Instance
		WWW <=	Outbound traffic <= Security Group <= Ec2 Instance

	Security Groups Deeper Dive 
		• Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances 
		• They regulate: 
		• Access to Ports 
		• Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6 
		• Control of inbound network (from other to the instance) 
		• Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

	Security Groups Good to know
		• Can be attached to multiple instances
		• Locked down to a region / VPC combination
		• It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
		• Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
			• If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
			• If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application error or it’s not launched
		• All inbound traffic is blocked by default
		• All outbound traffic is authorised by default

	Referencing other security groups Diagram

	Classic Ports to know
		• 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
		• 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
		• 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
		• 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
		• 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
		• 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance


Create a EC2 instance with EC2 user data to have a website Hands on
User Data on EC2 Instance Creation
#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html

	You should be able to access your windows system under the /mnt directory. 
	For example inside of bash, use this to get to your pictures directory:
	cd /mnt/c/Users/<windows.username>/Pictures



EC2 Instance Role demo
	aws iam list-users
		Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".
		Without aws configure command, 
			we can use here IAM Role using IAM>Roles>Create Role
			and then Actions>Security>Modify IAM Role>
			Now again aws iam list-users
			

EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
	• On-Demand Instances – short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
	• Reserved (1 & 3 years)
		• Reserved Instances – long workloads
		• Convertible Reserved Instances – long workloads with flexible instances
	• Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) –commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
	• Spot Instances – short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
	• Dedicated Hosts – book an entire physical server, control instance placement
	• Dedicated Instances – no other customers will share your hardware
	• Capacity Reservations – reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

	EC2 On Demand
		• Pay for what you use:
			• Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
			• All other operating systems - billing per hour
		• Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
		• No long-term commitment
		• Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, 
				where you can't predict how the application will behave

	EC2 Reserved Instances(RIs)
		• Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
		• You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
		• Reservation Period – 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount)
		• Payment Options – No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++)
		• Reserved Instance’s Scope – Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
		• Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
		• You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace
		
		Convertible Reserved Instance
			• Can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy
			• Up to 66% discount
		
	EC2 Savings Plans
		• Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% - same as RIs)
		• Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
		• Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
		• Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (e.g., M5 in us-east-1)
		• Flexible across:
			• Instance Size (e.g., m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
			• OS (e.g., Linux, Windows)
			• Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)

	EC2 Spot Instances
		• Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
		• Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
		• The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
		• Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
			• Batch jobs
			• Data analysis
			• Image processing
			• Any distributed workloads
			• Workloads with a flexible start and end time
		• Not suitable for critical jobs or databases


	EC2 Dedicated Hosts
		• A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
		• Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing server- bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, pe—VM software licenses)
		• Purchasing Options:
			• On-demand – pay per second for active Dedicated Host
			• Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
		• The most expensive option
		• Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL – Bring Your Own License)
		• Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

	EC2 Dedicated Instances • Instances run on hardware that’s dedicated to you
		• May share hardware with other instances in same account
		• No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)


	EC2 Capacity Reservations
		• Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any	duration
		• You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
		• No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
		• Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
		• You’re charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not
		• Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ


	Which purchasing option is right for me?
		• On demand: coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
		• Reserved: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
		• Savings Plans: pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room type (e.g.,
		King, Suite, Sea View, …)
		• Spot instances: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the
		rooms. You can get kicked out at any time
		• Dedicated Hosts: We book an entire building of the resort
		• Capacity Reservations: you book a room for a period with full price even you don’t stay in it

	Price Comparison
		Example – m4.large – us-east-1
		Price Type 								Price (per hour)
		On-Demand 								$0.10
		Spot Instance (Spot Price) 				$0.038 - $0.039 (up to 61% off)
