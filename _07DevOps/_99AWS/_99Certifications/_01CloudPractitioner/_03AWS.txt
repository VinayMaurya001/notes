	AWS Regions 
		A region is a cluster of data centers 
		AWS has Regions all around the world 
		Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3ï¿½ 
		Most AWS services are region-scoped
			
		How to choose an AWS Region?
			1)Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
				data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
			2)Proximity to customers: 
				reduced latency
			3)Available services within a Region: 
				new services and new features aren't available in every Region
			4)Pricing: 
				pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page
	
	AWS Availability Zones
		This Global Infrastructure identity is composed of one or more discrete data centers 
			with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, and are used to deploy infrastructure.
		Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example:
			ap-southeast-2a
			ap-southeast-2b
			ap-southeast-2c
		Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
		They are separate from each other, so that they are isolated from disasters
		They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
		
	
	AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)
		Amazon has 400+ Points of Presence (400+ Edge Locations & 10+ Regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries.
