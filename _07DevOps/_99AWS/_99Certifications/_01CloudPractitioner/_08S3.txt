S3
	• Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
	• It’s advertised as ”infinitely scaling” storage
	• Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone
	• Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well
	• Buckets store objects in Amazon S3.
	Amazon S3 Use cases 
		• Backup and storage 
		• Disaster Recovery 
		• Archive 
		• Hybrid Cloud storage 
		• Application hosting 
		• Media hosting 
		• Data lakes & big data analytics 
		• Software delivery 
		• Static website		
	Amazon S3 - Buckets
		• Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)
		• Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
		• Buckets are defined at the region level
		• S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
		• Naming convention
			• No uppercase, No underscore
			• 3-63 characters long
			• Not an IP
			• Must start with lowercase letter or number
			• Must NOT start with the prefix xn--
			• Must NOT end with the suffix -s3alias
	Amazon S3 - Objects
		• Objects (files) have a Key
		• The key is the FULL path:
			• s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
			• s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
		• The key is composed of prefix + object name
			• s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
		• There’s no concept of “directories” within buckets
			(although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
		• Just keys with very long names that contain slashes (“/”) 
		• Object values are the content of the body:
			• Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
			• If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
		• Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
		• Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
		• Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
	
Amazon S3 – Security
	• User-Based
		• IAM Policies – which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
	• Resource-Based
		• Bucket Policies – bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
		• Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain (can be disabled)
		• Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common (can be disabled)
	• Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
		• The user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
		• AND there’s no explicit DENY
	• Encryption: encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys
	• S3 Bucket Policies 
		• JSON based policies 
			• Resources: buckets and objects 
			• Effect: Allow / Deny 
			• Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny 
			• Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
		• Use S3 bucket for policy to: 
			• Grant public access to the bucket 
			• Force objects to be encrypted at upload 
			• Grant access to another account (Cross Account)
	• Example: 
		• Public Access - Use Bucket Policy
			Amazon S3=>Buckets=>Bucket Name=>Permissions
				=>Off Block public access (bucket settings) and add Bucket policy
			https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html
			{
			  "Id": "Policy1722315489378",
			  "Version": "2012-10-17",
			  "Statement": [
			    {
			      "Sid": "Stmt1722315484979",
			      "Action": [
			        "s3:GetObject"
			      ],
			      "Effect": "Allow",
			      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::anantmauryabucket1/*",
			      "Principal": "*"
			    }
			  ]
			}
		• User Access to S3 – IAM permissions
		• EC2 instance access - Use IAM Roles
		• Cross-Account Access –Use Bucket Policy
	• Bucket settings for Block Public Access
		• These settings were created to prevent company data leaks
		• If you know your bucket should never be public, leave these on
		• Can be set at the account level
	
Amazon S3 – Static Website Hosting
	• Amazon S3=>Buckets=>Bucket Name=>Properties=>Static website hosting
	• S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the Internet
	• The website URL will be (depending on the region)
		• http://bucket-name.s3-website-aws-region.amazonaws.com
		OR
		• http://bucket-name.s3-website.aws-region.amazonaws.com
	• If you get a 403 Forbidden error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!
	
	
Amazon S3 -Versioning
	• Amazon S3=>Buckets=>Bucket Name=>Properties=>Bucket Versioning
	• You can version your files in Amazon S3
	• It is enabled at the bucket level
	• Same key overwrite will change the “version”: 1, 2, 3….
	• It is best practice to version your buckets
		• Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
		• Easy roll back to previous version
	• Notes:
		• Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
		• Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions
	
	
	
	
Amazon S3 – Replication (CRR & SRR)
	• Amazon S3=>Buckets=>Bucket Name=>Management=>Replication rules=>(create new IAM Role & more)
	• Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
	• Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
	• Same-Region Replication (SRR)
	• Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
	• Copying is asynchronous
	• Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
	• Use cases:
		• CRR – compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
		• SRR – log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts

				you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
			• Same for all storage classes
		• Availability:
			• Measures how readily available a service is
			• Varies depending on storage class
			• Example: S3 standard has 99.99% availability = not available 53 minutes a year
			
	•S3 Standard – General Purpose

		• Lower cost than S3 Standard
		• Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
			• 99.9% Availability
			• Use cases: Disaster Recovery, backups
		• Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

• Hybrid Cloud for Storage
	• AWS is pushing for ”hybrid cloud”
		• Part of your infrastructure is on-premises
		• Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
	• This can be due to
		• Long cloud migrations
		• Security requirements
		• Compliance requirements
		• IT strategy
	• S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how do you expose the S3 data on-premise?
	• AWS Storage Gateway!
	• AWS Storage Cloud Native Options
		Block
			Amazon EBS
			EC2 Instance Store
		File
			Amazon EFS 
		Object-Objects are composed of key, value & metadata.
			Amazon S3
			Glacier
