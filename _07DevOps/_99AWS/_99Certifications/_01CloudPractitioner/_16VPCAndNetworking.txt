VPC – Crash Course
	• VPC is something you should know in depth for 
		the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate & AWS Certified SysOps Administrator
	• At the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Level, you should know about:
		• VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateways & NAT Gateways
		• Security Groups, Network ACL (NACL), VPC Flow Logs
		• VPC Peering, VPC Endpoints
		• Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
		• Transit Gateway
	• I will just give you an overview, less than 1 or 2 questions at your exam.
	• We’ll have a look at the “default VPC” (created by default by AWS for you)
	• There is a summary lecture at the end. It’s okay if you don’t understand it all
	
	
	
IP Addresses in AWS
	• IPv4 – Internet Protocol version 4 (4.3 Billion Addresses)
		• Public IPv4 – can be used on the Internet
		• EC2 instance gets a new a public IP address every time you stop then start it (default)
		• Private IPv4 – can be used on private networks (LAN) such as internal AWS networking(e.g., 192.168.1.1)
		• Private IPv4 is fixed for EC2 Instances even if you start/stop them
	• Elastic IP – allows you to attach a fixed public IPv4 address to EC2 instance
	• Note: all public IPv4 on AWS will be charged $0.005 per hour (including EIP)
		• Free Tier: 750 hours usage per month
	• IPv6 – Internet Protocol version 6 (3.4 × 10^38 Addresses)
		• Every IP address is public in AWS (no private range)
		• Example: 2001:db8:3333:4444:cccc:dddd:eeee:ffff
		• Free
		
		
VPC & Subnets Primer 
	• VPC - Virtual Private Cloud: private network to deploy your resources(regional resource)
	• Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC(Availability Zone resource)
	• A public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet
	• A private subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet
	• To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables
	• VPC Diagram
	
	
Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways
	• Internet Gateways helps our VPC instances connect with the internet
	• Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway.
	• NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) & NAT Instances (self-managed) allow your instances 
		in your Private Subnets to access the internet while remaining private
		
		
Network ACL & Security Groups
	• NACL (Network ACL)
		• A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet
		• Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
		• Are attached at the Subnet level
		• Rules only include IP addresses
	• Security Groups
		• A firewall that controls traffic to and from an EC2 Instance
		• Can have only ALLOW rules 
		• Rules include IP addresses and other security groups
	• Security Groups vs Network ACLs 
		•https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html
		•Security Group 						
			Operates at the instance level 
			Supports allow rules only 
			Is stateful: Return traffic is automatically allowed, 
			We evaluate all rules before deciding whether to allow traffic 
			Applies to an instance only if someone specifies the security group 
				when launching the instance, or associates the security group with the instance later on 
		•Network ACL
			Operates at the subnet level
			Supports allow rules and deny rules
			Is stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly regardless of any rules allowed by rules
			We process rules in number order when deciding whether to allow traffic
			Automatically applies to all instances in the subnets it's associated with 
				(therefore, you don't have to rely on users to specify the later on security group)
		
		
		
		
VPC Flow Logs
	• Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces:
		• VPC Flow Logs
		• Subnet Flow Logs
		• Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
	• Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues. Example:
		• Subnets to internet
		• Subnets to subnets
		• Internet to subnets
	• Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora, etc…
	• VPC Flow logs data can go to S3, CloudWatch Logs, and Kinesis Data Firehose
	
	
	
VPC Peering 
	• Connect two VPC, privately using AWS’ network
	• Make them behave as if they were in the same network
	• Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
	• VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)
			
			
		
		
		
VPC Endpoints
	• Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network
	• This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
	• VPC Endpoint Gateway: S3 & DynamoDB
	• VPC Endpoint Interface: the rest
		
		
		
AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services)
	• Most secure & scalable way to expose a service to 1000s of VPCs
	• Does not require VPC peering, internet gateway, NAT, route tables…
	• Requires a network load balancer (Service VPC) and ENI (Customer VPC)
	
	
Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect
	• Site to Site VPN
		• Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS
		• The connection is automatically encrypted
		• Goes over the public internet
		Site-to-Site VPN	
		• On-premises: must use a Customer Gateway (CGW)
		• AWS: must use a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
	• Direct Connect (DX)
		• Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
		• The connection is private, secure and fast
		• Goes over a private network
		• Takes at least a month to establish	
	
	
	
AWS Client VPN
	• Connect from your computer using OpenVPN to your private network in AWS and on-premises
	• Allow you to connect to your EC2 instances over a private IP (just as if you were in the private VPC network)
	• Goes over public Internet
	
	
	
Network topologies can become complicated



Transit Gateway 
	• For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on -premises, hub-and -spoke (star) connection
	• One single Gateway to provide this functionality
	• Works with Direct Connect Gateway, VPN connections
	
	
	
VPC Closing Comments
	• VPC – Virtual Private Cloud
	• Subnets – Tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC
	• Internet Gateway – at the VPC level, provide Internet Access
	• NAT Gateway / Instances – give internet access to private subnets
	• NACL – Stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound
	• Security Groups – Stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level or ENI
	• VPC Peering – Connect two VPC with non overlapping IP ranges, nontransitive
	• Elastic IP –fixed public IPv4, ongoing cost if not in-use
	• VPC Endpoints – Provide private access to AWS Services within VPC
	• PrivateLink – Privately connect to a service in a 3rd party VPC
	• VPC Flow Logs – network traffic logs
	• Site to Site VPN – VPN over public internet between on-premises DC and AWS
	• Client VPN – OpenVPN connection from your computer into your 	VPC
	• Direct Connect – direct private connection to AWS
	• Transit Gateway – Connect thousands of VPC and on-premises networks together
