	Shutdown Hook
		A shutdown hook is simply an initialized but unstarted thread. 
			When the virtual machine begins its shutdown sequence it will start all registered shutdown hooks in some unspecified order 
				and let them run concurrently.
		Registers a new virtual-machine shutdown hook.
			The Java virtual machine shuts down in response to two kinds of events:
				The program exits normally, when the last non-daemon thread exits or when the exit (equivalently, System.exit) method is invoked, or
				The virtual machine is terminated in response to a user interrupt, such as typing ^C, or a system-wide event, 
					such as user logoff or system shutdown.
					
					
					
					
Java Consumer inside Consumer Group
	Observe partition rebalance mechanism
	IntelliJIdea>Edit Configuration>Modify Options> Allow Multiple Instance
	
Consumer Groups & Partition Rebalance Strategies
	Moving partition between consumers is called a rebalance.
	Reassignment of partition happens when
		a consumer leaves or joins a group
		if an administrator add new partitions into a topic
	
	Eager Rebalance
		Default behaviour
		All consumers stop, give up their membership of partitions
		All consumers rejoin the consumer group & get a new partittion assignment
		Problems
			During a short period of time, the entire consumer group stops processing
			Consumers don't necessarily "get back" the same partitions as they used to before rebalance
	Cooperative rebalance(Incremental rebalance)
		Reassignment a small subset of the partittions from one consumer to another
		Other consumer that don't have reassigned partitions can still process uninterrupted
		Can go through several iterations to find a stable assignment(hence incremental)
		Avoid "stop the world" events where all consumers stop processing data
		
		Cooperative rebalance, how to use?
			Kafka Consumer: partition.assignment.strategy 
							(properties.setProperty(ConsumerConfig.PARTITION_ASSIGNMENT_STRATEGY_CONFIG, CooperativeStickyAssignor.class.getName());//none/earliest/latest)
				RangeAssignor
					assign partittion on a per-topic basis(can lead to imbalance)
				RoundRobin
					assign partittion across all topics in roundrobin fashion, optimal balance
				StickyAssignor
					balanced like round robin, & then minimise partition movements 
					when consumer join/leave group in order to minimize movements
				CooperativeStickyAssignor
					rebalance strategy is identical to StickyAssignor but supports Cooperative rebalances 
					& therefore consumers can keep on consuming from the topic
				The default assignor is [RangeAssignor,CooperativeStickyAssignor], 
					which will use the RangeAssignor by default, 
					but allows upgrading to the CooperativeStickyAssignor with just a single rolling bounce 
					that removes the RangeAssignor from the list
			Kafka Connect: Already implemented(Cooperative rebalance enabled by default)
			Kafka Stream: Cooperative rebalance turned on by default using StreamPartitionAssignor
			
	Static Group Membership
		By default, when consumer leaves a group , its partitions are revoked & re-assigned
		If it joins back, it will have a new "member Id" & new partittion assigned
		If we specify group.instance.id, it makes the consumer a static member
			Upon leaving , the consumer has up to session.timeout..ms to join back & get back its partitions(else rebalance will happen), without triggering a rebalance		
			This is helpful when consumers maintain local state & cache (TO Avoid rebuilding the cache)
		//properties.setProperty(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_INSTANCE_ID_CONFIG, "");
			
		
Java Consumer Auto offset Commit Behaviour
	In the Java Consumer API, offsets are regularly committed
	Enable at least once reading scenario by default(under conditions)
	Offsets are commited when we call poll() & auto.commit.interval.ms has elapsed
	Example: auto.commit.interval.ms=5000 & auto.commit=true will commit
	
	"Make sure messages are all successfully processed before we call poll() again."
		If we dont  we will not be in at least once reading scenario
		In that (rare) case we must disable enable.auto.commit 
			& most likely most processing to a separate thread 
			& then from time to time call .commitSync() or .commitASync() with the correct offsets manually(advanced).

Q)To allows consumers in a group to resume at the right offset, I need to set
Ans: group.id
Q)When my consumers have the same group.id
Ans: They will read from mutually-exclusive partitions
