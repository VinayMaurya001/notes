An Introduction to Apigee Edge
Learn about the central role that APIs play in innovation, and 
	how Apigee Edge enables you to manage APIs to power that innovation. 
There are three basic categories of capability in the API Management Platform:
- Support for your Developer ecosystems, to let people discover and 
	understand your APIs and rapidly build applications that use them.
- Monitoring and analytics, so that your API program managers can see which APIs are being used, 
	and how, or so they can get alerted when appropriate.
- An API runtime, so that you can expose usable, friendly, efficient, secure APIs.
