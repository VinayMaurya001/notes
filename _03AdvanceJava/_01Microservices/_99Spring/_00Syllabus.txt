Aware Interfaces to Add Specific Behavior
	Spring offers a range of interfaces that allow the beans to indicate to the container that they require a particular infrastructure dependency.
@PostConstruct and @PreDestroy Annotations
	@PostConstruct annotated method will be invoked after the bean has been constructed using default constructor and just before it’s instance is returned to requesting object.
	@PreDestroy annotated method is invoked just before the bean is about be destroyed inside bean container.
