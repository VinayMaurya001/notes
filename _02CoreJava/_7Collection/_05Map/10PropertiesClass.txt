Need of Properties
In our program if any thing which changes frequently (like username, password etc.) are not recommended to hard-code in Java program 
	because if there is any change then to reflect  that change re-compilation, re-build & re-deploy application are required. 
	Even sometimes server start also required. Which create big business impact to client.
We can overcome this problem by using properties file. Such type of variable things we have to configure in the properties file. 
	From that properties file, we have to read into Java program & we can use those properties. 
	
Advantages:
The main advantage of this approach is if there is a change in properties file, 
		to reflect that change just re-deployment is enough which won’t  create any business impact to the client.

We can use Java Properties object to hold properties which are coming from properties file.

Properties
In normal map like HashMap , HashTable, TreeMap etc. , key & value can be any type but in the case of Properties, key & value must be String type.

Constructors
Properties   properties=new Properties();

Methods in Properties
String(value or null)  getProperty(String name)
String(old  value)  setProperty(String name, String value)
Enumeration propertyNames()
void load( InputStream is)
	to load properties from properties file into java Properties object
void store( OutputStream os, String comment)
	to store properties from java Properties object into properties file. 

 
We can use here any file extension like .properties, .txt, .xml, .xyz etc.

Example:
		Properties p = new Properties();
		FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("E:\\eclipse\\projects\\coreJava\\src//_7Collection//_5Map//abc.properties");
		p.load(fis);
		System.out.println(p);
		
		String s = p.getProperty("venki");
		System.out.println(s);
		
		p.setProperty("nag", "8888");
		FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("E:\\eclipse\\projects\\coreJava\\src//_7Collection//_5Map//abc.properties");
		p.store(fos, "Updated By Programme");
		
	abc.properties
		#Updated By Programme
		#Sat Jul 20 17:43:32 IST 2019
		nag=8888
		venki=denki
