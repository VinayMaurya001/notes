TreeMap
Underlying ds-Red BlackTree
Duplicates key are not allowed but Duplicates values are allowed.
Insertion order not preserved , Sorting order of key
If we are depending on default natural sorting order then keys must be homogeneous & comparable. 
	Otherwise we will get RTE saying ClassCastException.
If we are defining our own sorting order using comparator then keys need not be homogeneous & comparable.
	We can take heterogeneous & non-comparable objects also.
Whether we are depending on default natural sorting order or customize sorting order, there are no restrictions for values. 
	We can take heterogeneous & non-comparable objects also.

Null acceptance of TreeMap upto 1.6v
	For empty TreeMap null insertion is possible. But after inserting this if we insert any other entry then  we will get NPE.
	For non-empty TreeMap null insertion is not possible because comparison is required // NPE

Null acceptance of TreeMap since 1.7v
	Null key is not possible for anyway.

Irrespective of version of Java, for values we can use null any number of times.

Constructors of TreeMap
	TreeMap() t =new TreeMap();
	TreeMap() t =new TreeMap(Comparator c);
	TreeMap() t =new TreeMap(Map m);
	TreeMap() t =new TreeMap(SortedMap m);..what is need of this???
