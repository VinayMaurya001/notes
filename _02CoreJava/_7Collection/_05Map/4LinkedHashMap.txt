LinkedHashMap
It is child class of HashMap.
It is exactly same as HashMap except the following differences:
	Underlying data structure is Hashtable + LinkedList(that is hybrid data structure)
	1.4v
	Insertion order must be preserved


Example
LinkedHasMap & LinkedHashSet are commonly used for developing Cache based application where duplicates are not allowed & 
	insertion order must be preserved.
