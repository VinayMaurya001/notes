WeakHashMap
It is exactly same as HashMap except the following difference:
	In the case of HashMap even though object doesn’t have any reference, 
		It is not eligible for gc  if it is associated with HashMap. 
		That is HashMap dominates GC.
	In the case of WeakHashMap if object doesn’t have any reference, 
		It is eligible for gc  if it is associated with WeakHashMap. 
		That is GC dominates WeakHashMap.
