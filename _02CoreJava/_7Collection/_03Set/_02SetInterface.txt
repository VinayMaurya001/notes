Set
It is the child interface of collection.
Duplicates are not allowed.
Insertion order not preserved.

Collection(I, 1.2V)
	Set(I, 1.2V)
 		HashSet( 1.2v)
			LinkedHashSet( 1.4v)
		SortedSet(I, 1.2V)
			NavigableSet(I, 1.6V)
				TreeSet( 1.2V)
								

1. Set is the child interface of Collection.
2. If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity, 
where duplicates are not allowed and insertion order is not preserved then we should go for Set.
3. Set interface doesn't contain any new methods. 
	So we have to use only Collection interface methods.
