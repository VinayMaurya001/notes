LinkedHashSet
It is child class of HashSet

It is exactly same as HashSet except the following differences:
	Underlying data structure is Hashtable + LinkedList(that is hybrid data structure) ???????
	1.4v
	Insertion order must be preserved

LinkedHashSet 
	Cache based application where duplicates are not allowed & insertion order must be preserved.


Primary memory-RAM=very fast
Secondary memory-very slow
	To balance performance differences, we use cache memory.
