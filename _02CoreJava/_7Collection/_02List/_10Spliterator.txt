The Spliterator interface in Java is used to traverse the elements of a collection one by one. 
	It is similar to the Iterator interface, but it is designed to support parallel processing of collections.

	The Spliterator interface is implemented by several classes in the Java Collections Framework, including ArrayList, HashSet, and TreeSet. 
	By implementing the Spliterator interface, a class can be used in the parallel stream processing of collections.
	
	
Difference between Iterator and Spliterator
Iterator was introduced in jdk 1.2 while Spliterator is introduced in jdk 1.8
Iterator is used for Collection API while Spliterator is used for Stream API
Iterator can be used for iterating the elements in Collection in sequential order while Spliterator can be used for iterating the Stream elements in parallel or sequential order.
