The Spliterator interface in Java is used to traverse the elements of a collection one by one. 
	It is similar to the Iterator interface, but it is designed to support parallel processing of collections.

	The Spliterator interface is implemented by several classes in the Java Collections Framework, including ArrayList, HashSet, and TreeSet. 
	By implementing the Spliterator interface, a class can be used in the parallel stream processing of collections.
